    "## A very brief introduction to object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern programming languages incorporate an object-oriented paradigm (**OOP**), including Python, R, Java, and C++. A central concept in OOP is treating data and functions as **objects**. Rather than memorizing the computer science definition, a useful way to think about an object is that data values are associated with specific properties and uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `my_var = [5, 2]` stores several values in memory: one byte indicates that the data type is list, one byte indicates its length, and a subsequent block of memory represents each item in the list, including its position in the list, its data type, and its value. This information is bundled into a single object with a consistent internal organization. Behind the scenes, Python understands that internal organization and knows, for example, that the first byte indicates a data type. It then knows where to find the \"data\" bytes and how to infer their data type, and only allows operationsconsistent with the properties of an integer (in this case). For example, it knows that these values cannot be divided by zero and that they can be added to another number but not to a string. In addition, Python uses the length value for indexing and to determine how many times to iterate in a functional programming context such as a list comprehension.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A list object is fairly straightforward object, but the real strength of objects comes with the ability to create a **class**: a definition of a customized object that can include multiple data types and data structures, associated meta-data, rules of use, and dedicated functions and methods. When you create a data object using a class definition, it is called an **instance** of the class. A class definition always includes a constructor function to create instances, and typically also includes additional methods and functions designed to work specifically with instances of that class. For example, `DataFrame` is a class that defines certain properties; when you call the `DataFrame()` constructor function it creates an instance with access to all the attributes, functions, and methods that this class provides. You could produce a data frame using other approaches, but it would not have access to these attributes, functions, and methods; you would need to write code yourself to find (for example) its dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Less obviously, functions are also objects in most OOP languages. In computer science terminology, functions are first-class entities. This means, for example, that a function can be passed as input to another function (or even to itself), which can be very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key OOP concept is **inheritance**, which is the ability to create new classes that incorporate the features of an existing class(data fields, attributes, and methods), with new capabilities. For example, consider the situation where you create a class to represent a phylogenetic tree, but later want to create a class that adds branch lengths. Inheritance allows you to keep the existing class, while creating a new one with the original features but adding a new data field and associated methods to work with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OOP languages also use data **abstraction**. This means that only certain parts of the data within an object are visible to functions (also known as data hiding). This helps reduce errors, as it prevents functions from accessing information that is not relevant, but the programmer might mistakenly try to incorporate. In addition, OOP uses **encapsulation** to hide the details of how data is organized and manipulated within a class from the broader programming environment. For example, consider the inheritance situation described in the previous paragraph. Creating a new sub-class involves changing the class definition and adding new methods. Encapsulation means that these changes won't break exisiting code that use it.  "

    "## The ETE3 library\n",
    "\n",
    "ETE is short for *Evolutionary Tree Exploration* version 3. The ETE3 library provides classes and functions for estimating, representing, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying trees and associated data. Access the website [here](https://etetoolkit.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a very basic introduction to ETE3. The goals are: (1) to show how ETE3 works with tree topology and associated data and (2) to demonstrate the value of object-oriented programming paradigms for solving real biological data analysis problems. There are many capabilities of ETE3 that this notebook does *not* cover, the two most important areas being tree reconstruction and data modeling and analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation.** Trees are used to represent a wide range of information in biology. The most common application of trees in biology is to represent *phylogenetic history*, including relationships among taxa at any level, trait evolution, ancestral state reconstruction, the history of gene duplications and losses, and more. Even if you are not an evolutionary biologist, trees can be very useful, as they are frequently used to represent *overall similarity* in just about anything of interest to a biologist, including morphologies, ecosystems, experimental treatments, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree vocabulary.** Trees consist of a set of nodes connted by branches. Each node can have 0 or more child nodes (by convention \"below\" the node) and at most 1 parent node (by convention \"above\" it). Nodes with 0 child nodes are called leaf nodes, while nodes with 1 or more child nodes are internal nodes. A tree may or may not include a root node; when present, it is the only node with 0 parent nodes; all other nodes have exactly 1 parent.   "

    "### ETE3 data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes that ETE3 uses to represent trees are `Tree` and `Node`. Because every node is essentially a tree in its own right, these classes are effectively synonymous; however, it's more explicit to use `Tree` to represent the entire tree, and `Node` when to represent a sub-tree. In keeping with the OOP paradigm, these classes define several data fields, in this case the topology of the tree, leaf node names, branch lengths, node support, as well as attributes such as the number of nodes, maximum and minimum depth of the tree. These classes also allow data of almost any kind to be attached to nodes, including single values, trait matrices, images, and DNA or protein sequences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ETE3 also provides several classes that use the OOP concept of inheritance: they have the properties of the `Tree` base class, but include additional attributes and methods to work with specific kinds of evolutionary trees. The class `PhyloTree` represents phylogenies of taxa, with nodes explicitly considered to be ancestors. The classes `Seqgroup` and `EvolTree` represent phylogenies of sequences rather than taxa. \n",
    "\n",
    "ETE3 uses the OOP principles of abstraction and encapsulation to create data objects that are designed to work mostly or entirely behind the scenes. For example, `.children()` returns a list of nodes below the one passed to the method; however the contents of the list is not a sequence of node names, but is instead defined by an internal class that is not intended for use by most programmers.

    "### Creating pointers to nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with specific nodes, we first need to create a **pointer** that tells ETE3 what position in the tree to refer to or operate on. This seems like a redundant step, since the node already has a label, but it is useful for two reasons. First, it allows abstraction (e.g., assignment of different nodes to the same identifier during program execution). Second, pointers are useful because they are not just string, but rather a class with attributes and methods. Once we define a pointer, we can extract information about the node, its parent node, and the sub-tree that it defines. We can also use the pointer to delete the node or sub-tree or use it as an insertion point for adding a node (see Manipulating tree structure, below)."

    "\n",
    "ETE3 provides several methods for manipulating the structure of an existing tree. It is possible to **delete** a single node with or without removing its child nodes. It is also possible to **detach** a leaf or internal node with its child nodes for further use. Finally, it is possible to **add** new nodes at any position. Adding a detached node is analogous to a cut-and-paste operation. \n",
