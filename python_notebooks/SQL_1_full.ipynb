    "### Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power of SQL is its ability to query data from multiple tables at once using (relatively) simple statements. This can be done by including a `JOIN` clause that specifies *how* to merge results and specifies one or more *relations* that link one or more columns between two or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commmon kind of join is a *left join*, where *every* row from the first table is returned, attached to *any* row from the second table where a value matches a row in the relation column(s) of the first table. If there is no match in the second table, `NULL` values will be inserted. Left joins allow for a one-to-many relationship between rows in the first table to those in the second table: a row from the first table might appear mutliple times if more than one row in the second table contains matching values in the related column. This is perfect for joining taxonomic tables, which have an inherently nested structure with a variable number of contents at each level and where every higher taxon contains at least one lower taxon (e.g., a family always contains at least one genus but it might contain more than one). Left joins are also useful for our `observations` table, where multiple records may be related to a single species or trip or location.     \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often the case that the same column name appears in multiple tables within a relational database. To make explicit which column of the same name you wish to reference, simply append the table name and a `.` before the column name. Columns specified in this way are said to be *fully qualified*. When writing queries that involve multiple tables, you only need to fully qualify if a column name exists in more than one table. However, fully qualifying is always allowed even when not needed, and doing so can make the logic of a query clearer. \n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple tables, using aliases for table names can help to simplify a query. A common convention is to use a single letters corresponding the table's full name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most versions of SQL accept more than one syntax for indicating a join. We'll use the newer and recommended syntax, but be aware that other ways to specify joins exist and are commonly used. Also be aware that it is possible (but not recommended) to create *implicit joins* by leaving out the `JOIN` keyword and simply specifying one or more relations in a `WHERE` clause. This produces a *cross join*, which can work in simple queries but is often not what you actually want. You will almost certainly encounter both of these alternative approaches if you refer to code from ChatGPT or StackOverflow. Best practice is to always use explicit joins and the syntax introduced below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by constructing a query that returns the number of species that have been observed within each country. The `observations` table only stores the name of a location, not the country is it located in; that information is stored in the `locations` table.
