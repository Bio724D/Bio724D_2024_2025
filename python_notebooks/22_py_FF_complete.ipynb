    "## Lambda functions\n",
    "Lambda functions are often described as \"anonymous\" or \"temporary\" functions. The examples above illustrate why they are useful. We can simplify and save several lines of code using `map()` or `filter()`; however, in many cases we need to define a function before we can take adavantage of these functions, which somewhat defeats the purpose. Lambda functions solve this problem by allowing us to define a function directly within the call to  `map()` or `filter()`. Lambda functions are also useful in other situations, including *comprehensions* (below). In addition, they are commonly used in Python code, so learning how they work is well worth the effort. In general, lambda functions are most useful when (1) you only need to call the function once and (2) the function is simple. "

To **alter** the result by applying a function or carrying out an operation, change the code to LHS of the loop. To **filter** the items, add a condition to the LHS of the loop. If you only want to alter the result, simply leave out a condition. If you only want to filter, include the loop variable on the LHS without applying a function or operation (as in the third example above). Finally, if you want to do both, they can be combined in a single comprehension (as in the final example above). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although comprehensions are most commonly applied to lists, they can be used with any iterable type. Note that you need to wrap the comprehension in the appropriate brackets (square, round, curly) to indicate which type of iterable you want back."

    "And third, it is possible to nest loops in a comprehension. This is useful for accessing every item in a matrix so that you can apply a function, carry out an operation, filter, or generate a Boolean index. Nesting can also be useful for simply generating a matrix. The example below generates a 5 x 5 matrix of the numbers 0...4. Note the nesting of square brackets to create an inner and outer loop. If you substitute round brackets in one or the other loop, you can generate a tuple of lists or a list of tuples (or any other compund data structure you wish to create). Also note the use of **anonymous variables**, since we do not need to refer to these variable again (the code will generate exactly the same result if you use i and j or some other variable name).  "
