A good rule of thumb for judging whether your solution is appropriately \"robust\" is to ask yourself \"If I added additional observations or variables to this data set, or if the order of variables changed, would my code still compute the right solution?\"\n",

Experiment and use whatever resources you prefer to find out what the following methods do when applied to a list: `.reverse()`, `.pop()`, and `.index()`.

    "3. Processing strings into smaller strings is called *splitting*. Your objective for this problem is to write code that splits `long_str` into six separate strings, each of which corresponds to one of the lines of the formatted output generated by the `print(long_str)` statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The core of this process is simpler than it may seem: use the `.split()` method and supply `'\\n'` (the escape sequence corresponding to return) as the argument. What type of data structure is returned? What are the items in it? What happened to the escape sequences for return?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now all you need to do is clean up the output to remove the escape sequences that indicate tabs. You could write a loop to check each item and remove `'\\t'` whenever present. But an easier way is simply to remove the tabs before splitting. You can do this with the `.replace()` method, which takes two arguments: the substring to search for and the substring to replace it with. \n",

    "* Some methods alter data objects *in place*, meaning that they change the original data. Others return a *copy* of the original, modifed according to the method, but leave the original unchanged. If the method returns a copy, you need to assign the result to a new variable name in order to save it for future use. Experiment to find out whether `.split()` and `.replace()` modify in place or return a copy. \n",

    "5. Tuples might seem fairly useless at first glance. Lists can be a more natural choice, since you can manipulate them (and they work like lists in R). However, it's worth getting to know how tuples work for two reasons. First, many standard functions return tuples. Second, you might want to create a tuple to prevent accidental loss of information or to save memory usage for very large data sets. For these reasons, its useful to learn how to work with tuples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a tuple from `tree_list` using the `tuple()` generator function: `tree_tuple = tuple(tree_list)`. Confirm that your new object is a tuple using `type()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The `tuple()` generator function is picky. What happens if you try to give it multiple individual items rather than the name of list? What happens if you pass a string to it? \n",
    "\n",
    "* A better way to generate a tuple from scratch is to use assignment and round brackets, for example: `my_tuple = ('eggs', 'spam', 'parrot')`. Now you can pass multiple items without raising an error, including items of different types. However, there is still one point to be aware of. Try passing just `'parrot'` and check the type of the object you just created. What happened? To fix this problem, simply place a comma after the single item; this is needed to tell Python that you indeed intend this to be a tuple that contains just one item rather than an atomic variable. To confirm that this works with all atomic data types, try passing a single integer, a single integer followed by a comma, and two integers separated by a comma; check the resulting data type each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Because tuples are immutable, attempting to use a method that modifies contents in place, like `.sort()` will raise an error. (Try it!) In fact, only two methods are allowed with tuples: `.count()` and `.index()`. Using `tree_tuple` experiment and consult sources to find out what these two methods do. Write a one-sentence description of each method and provide an example using `tree_tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even though you can't sort a tuple in place, you can assign the sorted contents of a tuple to a list using the `sorted()` function. This process leaves the tuple unmodified, but returns a sorted list. Confirm that you can extract a correctly sorted list from `tree_tuple` by comparing to an in-place sort of the original `tree_list` object. Extracting all or part of a tuple and assigning to another data object is a common way to use and manipulate the values in a tuple. "
