    "2.  Dictionaries are common in Python programming because they are highly optimized for \"look up\" operations: cases where you know the key and want to retrieve the value(s) it is associated with. A data frame constructed from nested lists can provide the same functionality, but will typically be much slower because it is built on a different data structure. Let's have the best of both worlds and construct a data fame using a dictionary. \n",

Note that `zip()`'s behavior is different from R, where \"recycling\" is typically used to force vectors to be equal. \n",

    "\n",
    "    * Dictionaries have a order, which is specified when they are created or updated. Unlike lists, you can't easily alter this order. What happens when you try to apply `sort()`? If you want to re-order a dictionary, the best approach is to make a copy. We won't do that right now as it's a bit awkward. (All data structures have strengths and weaknesses!) But we can copy the keys into a list using `.keys()`. Write code to return the name of the mammal that is is alphabetically last.     \n",

    "3. This problem and the next two build on the [Boolean network simulation model](https://github.com/Bio724D/Bio724D_2023_2024/blob/main/python_notebooks/boolean_networks_example.ipynb) we examined previously. Starting with the function definitions and the basic boolean network model (\"core of the simulation\"), your task is to extend the code to check every possible starting condition in a single run. The first step is to explicitly enumerate all the possible staring conditions. With 3 nodes and 2 possible conditions for each, the number of permutations is 8. These need to be placed into a nested list of lists so that your program can step through each unique combination of starting conditions, one at a time:     \n",
    "`[[True, True, True], [True, True, False], ...]`  \n",
    "There are 3 ways you could construct this nested list: (1) write it out by hand; (2) use nested for loops (one for each node and one for each condition); or (3) use a method in the `itertools` module, which is part of the Python Standard Libary. Any of these options is okay for solving this problem. However, note that the first option is simple with a small number of starting conditions, but does **not** scale well if there are more nodes! "

    "4. Once you have enumerated all the possible starting conditions, the next step is to place the simulation inside a `for` loop so that it carries out a simulation for each set of starting conditions. During each loop, you will need to extract the next item in the nested list and assign its contents to the initial values of `V1`, `V2`, and `V3` before running the simulation. "

    "5. Testing every possible set of starting conditions allows us to evaluate their impact on the outcome of the simulation. Let's now automate the process of comparing those outputs. One way to think about the behavior of boolean networks is that the system sometimes oscillates between 2 or more states and sometimes becomes fixed in single state. Let's focus on the simpler case and count how many starting conditions lead to behavior that becomes fixed. We can define \"fixed\" as a situation where the last 10 iterations have precisely the same state. When the simulation finishes looping, the lists `V1`, `V2`, and `V3` contain the information you need to  determination whether fixed is True or False. Store that value in a list where each item is itself a list that contains two items: (1) the starting condition and (2) the truth value for fixed. You can either represent the starting condition as another list (e.g., `[True, False, False]`) or encode it as a string represention (e.g., `'TFF'`). **Bonus:** are you able to draw any conclusion about the boolean model from your measurement?
