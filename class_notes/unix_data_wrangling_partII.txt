# Read about the GFF file format for genome annotation here:
# https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md

# Create ~/data and ~/analysis directories on your VM

# Download the budding yeast GFF file directly to you VM using `wget` to ~/data

# In ~/analysis, create a symbolic link with a to the yeast GFF file with a more friendly name

# Examine yeast GFF file using head, tail, and less, wc

# Split GFF file in tabular data and sequence data

# Remove metadata from tabular data file

# How many genome features are recognized in the yeast genome?

# What are the types of features?

# How many genes are there?

# Generated a count of all the features sorted from most to least frequent

# How many genes are encoded on each chromosome?

# What is the nucleotide composition of the yeast genome?

# Find the gene features related to the the cAMP-PKA pathway? What are the common names of these features? Repeat this for the TOR pathway and the RIM101 pathway.
