### Other commonly used Unix commands

* `cut` -- removes sections (bytes, characters, or fields) from input
  - For this example create a file (`columns.txt`) with the following command (`\t` = TAB character, `\n` = newline character): 
    `echo -e 'one\ttwo\tthree\nfour\tfive\tsix' > columns.txt`
  If you open the file you will see it is formatted like this:
    ```
    one     two     three
    four    five    six
    ```
  - `cut -f 2 columns.txt`: get the second column (`cut` assumes columns are separated by tabs by default)
  - `cut -f1,3 columns.txt` get first and third column

* `paste` -- merge corresponding lines from inputs
  - `paste columns.txt columns.txt`
  - `tac columns.txt | paste columns.txt -`: the dash (`-`) here specifies that input should come from stdin. Can you guess what the command `tac` does?
  - `paste -s columns.txt`: The `-s` command merges lines within the file. This gives us behavior that is like the inverse of the `fold` command we saw previously.

* `fold` -- wrap lines to the specified with, printing to stdout
  - `fold -w 5 file.txt`:
  - `echo 12345 | fold -w 1`


* `sed` -- sed is a "stream editor", a tool that offers powerful text manipulation capabilities.  For the purposes of this introduction we're going to focus on just one use case -- text substitution.
  - `echo "Hello world, Hello universe" | sed 's/Hello/Goodbye/`: substitute the first occurence of "Hello" with "Goodbye"
  - `echo "Hello world, Hello universe" | sed 's/Hello/Goodbye/'`: substitute the all occurences of "Hello" with "Goodbye" (the `g` at the end of the sed command means "globally")
  - `echo "Hello world, Hello universe" | sed 's/Hello//g'`: delete all occurences of "Hello"



* `ln` -- make links between files.  Typically you'll want to create "symbolic links" (symlinks), which act like "shortcuts" on Windows systems. Links are useful to create references to files located nested deep in directory hierarchies or with long and tedious names. 
    - Example: 

        ```
        ln -s ~/data/saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-5-1_20240529.gff ~/analysis/yeast.gff
        ```
