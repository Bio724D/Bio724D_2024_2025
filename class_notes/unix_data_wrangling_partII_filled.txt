# Read about the GFF file format for genome annotation here:
# https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md

# Create ~/data and ~/analysis directories on your VM

# Download the budding yeast GFF file directly to you VM using `wget` within ~/data

# In ~/analysis, create a symbolic link with a to the yeast GFF file with a more friendly name
# ln -s ~/data/saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-5-1_20240529.gff ./yeast.gff

# Examine yeast GFF file using head, tail, and less, wc

# Deterine where the ##FASTA metaline occurs

grep -n "##FASTA" yeast.gff

# Split GFF file in tabular data and sequence data

head -n 28370 yeast.gff > yeast_tabular.gff
tail -n +28370 yeast.gff > yeast_sequence.fasta

# Remove metadata from tabular data file

grep -v "^#" yeast_tabular.gff > yeast_tabular_clean.gff

# How many genome features are recognized in the yeast genome?

wc -l yeast_tabular_clean.gff 

# What are the types of features?

cut -f 3 yeast_tabular_clean.gff | sort | uniq

# How many genes are there?

cut -f 3 yeast_tabular_clean.gff | grep -c -w gene

# Generated a count of all the features sorted from most to least frequent

cat yeast_tabular_clean.gff | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n -r

## Get a count of features per chromosome

cat yeast_tabular_clean.gff | cut -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n -r

# How many genes are encoded on each chromosome?

cat yeast_tabular_clean.gff | cut -f 1,3 | grep -w gene | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n -r

# What is the nucleotide composition of the yeast genome?

grep -v "^#" yeast_sequence.fasta | grep -v "^>" | fold -w 1 | grep -c "T"

# Find the gene features related to the the cAMP-PKA pathway? What are the common names of these features? Repeat this for the TOR pathway and the RIM101 pathway.
